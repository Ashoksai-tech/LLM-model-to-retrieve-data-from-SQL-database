# 🌟 LLM SQL Query Retrieval System

## 📖 Overview

The **LLM SQL Query Retrieval System** is an innovative application that allows users to interact with SQL databases using natural language commands. By leveraging advanced language models and an intuitive interface, users can easily retrieve information from their uploaded databases without needing extensive SQL knowledge.

## 🚀 Features

- **Natural Language Interface**: Ask questions or request specific data in plain language! 🗣️
- **Dynamic Query Generation**: Automatically generates and executes SQL queries based on user input. 🔄
- **Database Upload**: Seamlessly upload your SQL databases for easy interaction. 📂
- **Response Generation**: Get informative responses based on the retrieved data. 📊

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language for backend development. 🐍
- **Streamlit**: Used to build the interactive web application interface. 🌐
- **SQL**: For database management and query execution. 🗄️
- **OpenAI API**: Utilized for natural language processing and query generation. 🤖

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Database Upload**: Users upload their SQL database files through the Streamlit interface. 📤
2. **User Commands**: Input natural language queries to ask questions about the database (e.g., "What are the sales figures for last month?"). ❓
3. **Query Retrieval**:
   - The application processes the user's command using the OpenAI API to generate the corresponding SQL query. 🔍
   - The generated SQL query is executed against the uploaded database. 🔄
4. **Response Display**: The retrieved data is displayed in a user-friendly format, allowing users to easily understand the results. 📈
